The interface to the C++23 Standard Library consists of 107 header files, 21 of which present the C Standard Library. Starting with C++23, you simply import the named module std to get access to the entire Standard Library, as has been done in all examples throughout this book. There is no longer a need to explicitly import or include individual header files, except for certain non-importable header files, such as <cassert>. However, if your compiler does not yet support the C++23 std named module, then you need to import or include the appropriate header files. In that case, itâ€™s often difficult to remember which header files you need to include in your source code, so this appendix provides a brief description of the most useful functionality of each header, organized into eight categories:

\begin{itemize}
\item
The C Standard Library

\item
Containers

\item
Algorithms, iterators, ranges, and allocators

\item
General utilities

\item
Mathematical utilities

\item
Exceptions

\item
I/O streams

\item
Threading support library
\end{itemize}
