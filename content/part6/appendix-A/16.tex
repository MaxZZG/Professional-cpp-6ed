The C++ Standard Library provides the chrono library, which allows you to work with dates and times. It is unlikely that an interviewer will ask detailed questions about this functionality, but she might gauge whether youâ€™ve heard about this part of the Standard Library.

\mySubsubsection{A.16.1.}{Things to Remember}

\begin{itemize}
\item
Compile-time rational numbers

\item
What durations, clocks, and time points are

\item
What dates and calendars are

\item
The possibility of converting dates and times between different time zones
\end{itemize}

\mySubsubsection{A.16.2.}{Types of Questions}

Instead of asking you any detailed questions about the chrono library, an interviewer might explain a problem involving dates and times and ask you how you would tackle it. If you explain that you would implement your own classes to work with dates and times, be prepared to explain why. A better approach is to explain that you would use the functionality provided by the chrono library. Remember, reuse of code is an important programming paradigm.
