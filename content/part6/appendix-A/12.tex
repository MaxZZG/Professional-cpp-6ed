If you’re interviewing for a job writing GUI applications, you probably won’t get too many questions about I/O streams, because GUI applications tend to use other mechanisms for I/O. However, streams can come up in other problems, and as a standard part of C++, they are fair game as far as the interviewer is concerned.

\mySubsubsection{A.12.1.}{Things to Remember}

\begin{itemize}
\item
The definition of a stream

\item
Basic input and output using streams

\item
The concept of manipulators

\item
Types of streams (console, file, string, and so on)

\item
Error-handling techniques

\item
The existence of a standard filesystem API
\end{itemize}

\mySubsubsection{A.12.2.}{Types of Questions}

I/O may come up in the context of any question. For example, the interviewer could ask you to read in a file containing test scores and put them in a vector. This question tests basic C++, Standard Library, and I/O skills.
