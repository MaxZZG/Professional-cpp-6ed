Because design patterns are popular in the professional world (many candidates even list them as skills), it’s likely that you’ll encounter an interviewer who wants you to explain a pattern, give a use case for a pattern, or implement a pattern.

\mySubsubsection{A.25.1.}{Things to Remember}

\begin{itemize}
\item
The basic idea of a pattern as a reusable object-oriented design concept

\item
The patterns you have read about in this book, as well as others that you’ve used in your work

\item
The fact that you and your interviewer may use different words for the same pattern, given that there are hundreds of patterns with often-conflicting names
\end{itemize}

\mySubsubsection{A.25.2.}{Types of Questions}

Answering questions about design patterns is usually a walk in the park, unless the interviewer expects you to know the details of every single pattern known to humankind. Luckily, most interviewers who appreciate design patterns will just want to chat with you about them and get your opinions. After all, looking up concepts in a book or online instead of memorizing them is a good pattern in itself.
