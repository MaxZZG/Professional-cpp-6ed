Each of the techniques presented in Chapter 32 makes a fine interview question. Rather than repeat what you already read in the chapter, I suggest that you skim over Chapter 32 prior to an interview to make sure that you are able to understand each of the techniques.

If you are being interviewed for a GUI-based job, you should know about the existence of frameworks such as MFC, Qt, and possibly others.
