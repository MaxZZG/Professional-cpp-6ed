This chapter is mostly focused on modules, but it also discusses header files, linkage, feature test macros for core language features, the static keyword, C-style variable-length argument lists, and preprocessor macros.

\mySubsubsection{A.10.1.}{Things to Remember}

\begin{itemize}
\item
The many uses of static

\item
What modules are and why their use is preferred over using header files

\item
Header file syntax and \#include

\item
The concept of preprocessor macros and their disadvantages

\item
The use of \#define and \#pragma once

\item
The different types of linkage: no linkage, external linkage, internal linkage, and module linkage

\item
Why you shouldn’t use C-style variable-length argument lists
\end{itemize}

\mySubsubsection{A.10.2.}{Types of Questions}

Asking a candidate to define static is a classic C++ interview question. Because the keyword has several uses, it can be used to assess the breadth of your knowledge. You should definitely talk about static member functions and static data members and give good examples of them. You’ll get extra points if you also explain static linkage and static function-local variables.

Modules are the perfect way to make code reusable and bolster clear separation of responsibilities. Be sure to know how to consume modules and how to author a basic module.
