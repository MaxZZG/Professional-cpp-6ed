This chapter discusses a few additional vocabulary types provided by the C++ Standard Library. An interviewer might touch on a few of these topics to get an idea of the breadth of your Standard Library knowledge.

\mySubsubsection{A.18.1.}{Things to Remember}

\begin{itemize}
\item
The std::variant and any vocabulary data types, and how they complement optional

\item
std::tuple as a generalization of pair

\item
What the std::expected vocabulary type is and how to use it (C++23)

\item
What monadic operations for optional and expected are (C++23)
\end{itemize}

\mySubsubsection{A.18.2.}{Types of Questions}

You might be asked what the use cases are for the variant, any, and tuple data structures. While explaining variant and any, you can also contrast these with the optional vocabulary type from Chapter 1.

You will impress the interviewer if you can explain the C++23 expected data type and show its use with a small example.
