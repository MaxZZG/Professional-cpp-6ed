This chapter discussed the key aspects of efficiency and performance in C++ programs and provided several specific tips and techniques for designing and writing more efficient applications. Ideally, you gained an appreciation for the importance of performance and for the power of profiling tools.

There are two important things to remember from this chapter. The first thing is that you should not get too obsessed with performance while designing and coding. It’s recommended to first make a correct, well-structured design and implementation, then use a profiler, and only optimize those parts that are flagged by a profiler as being a performance bottleneck.

The second and most important thing to remember from this chapter is that design-level efficiency is far more important than language-level efficiency. For example, you shouldn’t use algorithms or data structures with bad complexity if there are better ones available.
