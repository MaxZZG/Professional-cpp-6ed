By solving the following exercises, you can practice the material discussed in this chapter. Solutions to all exercises are available with the code download on the book’s website at \url{www.wiley.com/go/proc++6e}. However, if you are stuck on an exercise, first reread parts of this chapter to try to find an answer yourself before looking at the solution from the website.

\begin{itemize}
\item
Exercise 29-1: What are the two most important things to remember from this chapter?

\item
Exercise 29-2: Modify the final NameDB solution from the “Profiling” section to use an std::unordered\_map instead of a map. Profile your code before and after your changes and compare the results.

\item
Exercise 29-3: From the profiling results of Exercise 29-2, it now looks like operator>{}> in the NameDB constructor is the bottleneck. Can you change the implementation to avoid using operator>{}>? Since each line in the input file contains one name, maybe it’s faster to simply use std::getline()? Try to modify your implementation as such and compare the profiling results before and after your changes.
\end{itemize}
