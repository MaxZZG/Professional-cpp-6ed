通过解决下面的练习，可以练习本章讨论的内容。所有练习的解决方案都可以在本书的网站\url{www.wiley.com/go/proc++6e}下载到源码。然而，若在练习中卡住了，在从网站上寻找解决方案之前，可以考虑先重读本章的部分内容，试着自己找到答案。

\begin{itemize}
\item
Exercise 29-1: What are the two most important things to remember from this chapter?

\item
Exercise 29-2: Modify the final NameDB solution from the “Profiling” section to use an std::unordered\_map instead of a map. Profile your code before and after your changes and compare the results.

\item
Exercise 29-3: From the profiling results of Exercise 29-2, it now looks like operator>{}> in the NameDB constructor is the bottleneck. Can you change the implementation to avoid using operator>{}>? Since each line in the input file contains one name, maybe it’s faster to simply use std::getline()? Try to modify your implementation as such and compare the profiling results before and after your changes.
