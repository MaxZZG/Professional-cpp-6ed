This chapter has given you just a taste of how patterns can help you organize object-oriented concepts into high-level designs. A lot of design patterns are cataloged and discussed on Wikipedia (\url{en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_design_pattern}). It’s easy to get lost with the sheer number of available patterns. I recommend that you concentrate on a few patterns that interest you and slowly build up your arsenal of patterns.

I would like to conclude this chapter with the following quote, which expresses the reason why we use patterns:

\textit{
The use of [design patterns] provides us in our daily lives with decisive speed advantages for understanding complex structures. This is also why patterns found their way into software development years ago. . . . Consistently applied patterns help us deal with the complexity of source code.
