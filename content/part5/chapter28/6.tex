This chapter introduced you to several models and methodologies for the software development process. There are certainly many other ways of building software, both formal and informal. There probably isnâ€™t a single correct method for developing software except the method that works for your team. The best way to find this method is to do your own research, learn what you can from various methods, talk to your peers about their experiences, and iterate on your process. Remember, the only metric that matters when examining a process methodology is how much it helps your team to write code.

The final part of this chapter explained the concept of version control. This should be an integral part of any software company, big or small, and is even beneficial for personal projects at home. There are several version control software solutions available, both free and commercial. I recommend that you try a few and see which one of them works for you.
