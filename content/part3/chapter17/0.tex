Chapter 16, “Overview of the C++ Standard Library,” introduces the Standard Library, describes its basic philosophy, and provides an overview of the provided functionality. This chapter begins a more-in-depth tour of the Standard Library by covering the ideas behind iterators used throughout a big part of the library. It also discusses the available stream iterators and iterator adapters. The second part of the chapter discusses the ranges library, a powerful library that allows for more functional-style programming: you write code that specifies what you want to accomplish instead of how.
