A random number engine adapter modifies the result of a random number engine you associate it with, which is called the base engine. This is an example of the adapter pattern (see Chapter 33, “Applying design patterns”). The following three adapter templates are defined:

\begin{cpp}
template<class Engine, size_t p, size_t r> class discard_block_engine {...}
template<class Engine, size_t w, class UIntT> class independent_bits_engine {...}
template<class Engine, size_t k> class shuffle_order_engine {...}
\end{cpp}

The discard\_block\_engine adapter generates random numbers by discarding some of the values generated by its base engine. It requires three parameters: the engine to adapt, the block size p, and the used block size r. The base engine is used to generate p random numbers. The adapter then discards p-r of those numbers and returns the remaining r numbers.

The independent\_bits\_engine adapter generates random numbers with a given number of bits w by combining several random numbers generated by the base engine.

The shuffle\_order\_engine adapter generates the same random numbers that are generated by the base engine but delivers them in a different order. The template parameter k is the size of an internal table used by the adapter. A random number is randomly selected from this table upon request, and then replaced with a new random number generated by the base engine.

Just as with random number engines, a number of predefined engine adapters are available. The next section gives an overview of the predefined engines and engine adapters.
