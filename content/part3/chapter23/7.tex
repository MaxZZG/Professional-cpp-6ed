In this chapter, you learned how to use the C++ random number generation library provided by the Standard Library to generate good-quality random numbers. You also saw how you can change the distribution of the generated numbers over a given range.

The next chapter is the last chapter of Part 3 of the book and introduces a number of additional vocabulary types that you will use often in your day-to-day coding.
