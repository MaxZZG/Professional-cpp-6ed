This chapter explained the concept of callbacks, which are functions that are passed to other functions to customize their behavior. You’ve seen that callbacks can be function pointers, function objects, or lambda expressions. You also learned that lambda expressions allow you to write more readable code than composing operations using function objects and adapter function objects. Remember, writing readable code is as important, if not more important, than writing code that works. So, even if a lambda expression is a bit longer than an adapted function object, the lambda expression will be more readable and hence more maintainable.

Now that you are fluent in working with callbacks, it’s time to delve into the true power of the Standard Library with a discussion of its generic algorithms.
