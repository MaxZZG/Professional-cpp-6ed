This chapter starts with a discussion of localization, which allows you to write software that can be localized to different regions around the world. An application that is properly localized displays numbers, dates, currencies, and so on in the appropriate format according to rules for a specific country or region.

The second part of this chapter introduces the regular expressions library, which makes it easy to perform pattern matching on strings. It allows you to search for substrings matching a given pattern, but also to validate, parse, and transform strings. Regular expressions are powerful. I recommend that you use them, as they are less error prone than manually writing your own string processing code.
