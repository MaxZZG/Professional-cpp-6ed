This chapter provided coding examples for a selection of Standard Library algorithms. It also showed you that combining these algorithms with lambda expressions allows you to write elegant and easyto-understand code. Together with the previous chapters, I hope you gained an appreciation for the usefulness and the power of the Standard Library containers and algorithms.

The following chapters continue the discussion of other C++ Standard Library functionality. Chapter 21 discusses regular expressions. Chapter 22 explains the date and time support. Chapter 23 shows how to generate random numbers. Chapter 24 covers a number of additional vocabulary types that are available for you to use. Finally, Chapter 25 gives a taste of some more advanced features, such as allocators and how to write your own Standard Libraryâ€“compliant algorithms and containers.
