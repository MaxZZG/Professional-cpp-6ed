This chapter described the issues related to error handling in C++ programs and emphasized that you must design and code your programs with an error-handling plan. By reading this chapter, you learned the details of C++ exceptions syntax and behavior. You learned how to write custom exception classes that automatically embed the location where an exception was raised and the full stack trace at that moment. The chapter also covered some of the areas in which error handling plays a large role, including I/O streaming, memory allocation, constructors, and destructors. The chapter finished with the different kinds of exception safety guarantees a function can provide.
