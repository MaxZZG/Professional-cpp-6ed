In this chapter, you learned the ins and outs of dynamic memory. Aside from memory-checking tools and careful coding, there are two key takeaways to avoid dynamic memory-related problems.

First, you need to understand how pointers work under the hood. After reading about two different mental models for pointers, you should now know how the compiler doles out memory.

Second, you should avoid raw pointers when ownership is involved, and avoid using old C-style constructs and functions. Instead, use safe C++ alternatives, such as objects that automatically manage their memory, like the C++ string class, the vector container, smart pointers, and so on.
