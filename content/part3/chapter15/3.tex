The bitwise operators are similar to the arithmetic operators, and the bitwise shorthand assignment operators are similar to the arithmetic shorthand assignment operators. However, they are significantly less common, so no examples are shown here. The table in the section “Summary of Overloadable Operators” shows sample prototypes, so you should be able to implement them easily if the need ever arises.

The logical operators are trickier. It’s not recommended to overload \&\& and ||. These operators don’t really apply to individual types: they aggregate results of Boolean expressions. Additionally, when overloading these operators, you lose the short-circuit evaluation, because both the left-hand side and the right-hand side have to be evaluated before they can be bound to the parameters of your overloaded operator \&\& and ||. Thus, it rarely, if ever, makes sense to overload them for specific types.
