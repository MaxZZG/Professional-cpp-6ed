In addition to class templates, class member function templates, and function templates, C++ supports variable templates. The syntax is as follows:

\begin{cpp}
template <typename T>
constexpr T pi { T { 3.141592653589793238462643383279502884 } };
\end{cpp}

This is a variable template for the value of π. To get the value of pi in a certain type, you use the following syntax:

\begin{cpp}
float piFloat { pi<float> };
auto piLongDouble { pi<long double> };
\end{cpp}

You will always get the closest value of pi representable in the requested type. Just like other types of templates, variable templates can also be specialized.

The C++ Standard Library includes <numbers>, which defines a selection of commonly used mathematical constants, including π: std::numbers::pi.
