This chapter gave an overview of additional vocabulary types provided by the C++ Standard Library. You learned how to use the variant and any vocabulary data types. You also learned about tuples, which are a generalization of pairs, and the operations you can apply to tuples. You discovered the power of monadic operations for optionals allowing you to easily chain operations on optionals. The chapter finished with expected, a vocabulary type capable of holding either a value of a certain type or an error.

This chapter concludes Part 3 of the book. The next part discusses some more advanced topics and starts with a chapter showing you how to customize and extend the functionality provided by the C++ Standard Library by implementing your own Standard Libraryâ€“compliant algorithms and data structures.
