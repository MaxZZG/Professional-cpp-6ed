This chapter of the Standard Library deep-dive chapters covers the available containers. It explains the different containers, their categories, and what the trade-offs are between them.

Some containers are discussed in much more detail compared to others. Once you know how to work with a container of each category, you will have no problems using any of the other containers from the same category. Consult your favorite Standard Library Reference for a complete reference of all member functions of all containers.
