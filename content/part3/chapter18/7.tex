This chapter introduced the Standard Library containers. It also presented sample code illustrating a variety of uses for these containers. Ideally, you appreciate the power of vector, deque, list, forward\_list, array, span, mdspan, stack, queue, priority\_queue, map, multimap, set, multiset, unordered\_map, unordered\_multimap, unordered\_set, unordered\_multiset, flat\_map, flat\_multimap, flat\_set, flat\_multiset, string, and bitset. I recommend using these containers as much as possible instead of writing your own.

Before we can delve into the true power of the Standard Library with a discussion of its generic algorithms and how they work with the containers discussed in this chapter, we have to explain function pointers, function objects, and lambda expressions. Those are the topics of the next chapter.
