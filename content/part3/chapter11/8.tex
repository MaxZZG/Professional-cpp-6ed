This chapter started with details on authoring and consuming modules and discussed a few trickier aspects of using old-style header files. You also learned about preprocessor directives, preprocessor macros, details of linkage, the one definition rule, and the different uses of the static and extern keywords. The chapter finished with a discussion on how to write C-style variable-length argument lists.

Preprocessor directives and C-style variable-length argument lists are important to understand, because you might encounter them in legacy code bases. However, they should be avoided in any newly written code.

The next chapter starts a discussion on templates allowing you to write generic code.
