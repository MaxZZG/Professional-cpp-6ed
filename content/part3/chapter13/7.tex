Streams provide a flexible and object-oriented way to perform input and output. The most important message in this chapter, even more important than the use of streams, is the concept of a stream. Some operating systems may have their own file access and I/O facilities, but knowledge of how streams and stream-like libraries work is essential to working with any type of modern I/O system.

The chapter finished with an introduction to the filesystem support library, which you can use to
work with files and directories in a platform-independent manner.
