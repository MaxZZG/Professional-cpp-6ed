This chapter covered numerous details about inheritance. You learned about its many applications, including code reuse and polymorphism. You also learned about its many abuses, including poorly designed multiple-inheritance schemes. Along the way, you uncovered some cases that require special attention.

Inheritance is a powerful language feature that takes some time to get used to. After you have worked with the examples in this chapter and experimented on your own, I hope that inheritance will become your tool of choice for object-oriented design.
