Dedicated to my amazing parents and brother, whose continuous support and patience help me in tackling such a big project as writing this book.

I THANK THE JOHN WILEY \& SONS editorial and production teams for their support. A special thankyou to Jim Minatel, executive editor at Wiley, for giving me a chance to write this sixth edition; Pete Gaughan, senior managing editor; Ashirvad Moses Thyagarajan, managing editor; Kathryn Hogan, PhD, project manager; Archana Pragash, content refinement specialist; and Kim Wimpsett, copyeditor.

A special thank you to technical editors Bradley Jones and Arthur O’Dwyer for checking the technical accuracy of the book. Their feedback and numerous contributions have strengthened this book and are greatly appreciated.

Of course, the support and patience of my parents and my brother were very important in finishing this book. I would also like to express my sincere gratitude to my employer, Nikon Metrology, for supporting me during this project.

Finally, I thank you, the reader, for supporting me over all these years and across numerous editions with this approach to professional C++ software development.
