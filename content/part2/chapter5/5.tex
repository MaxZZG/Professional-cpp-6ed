In this chapter, you’ve gained an appreciation for the design of object-oriented programs without a lot of code getting in the way. The concepts you’ve learned are applicable to almost any object-oriented language. Some of it may have been a review to you, or it may be a new way of formalizing a familiar concept. Perhaps you picked up some new approaches to old problems or new arguments in favor of the concepts you’ve been preaching to your team all along. Even if you’ve never used classes in your code, or have used them only sparingly, you now know more about how to design object-oriented programs than many experienced C++ programmers.

The relationships between classes are important to study, not just because well-linked classes contribute to code reuse and reduce clutter, but also because you will be working in a team. Classes that relate in meaningful ways are easier to read and maintain. You may decide to use the “Class Relationships” section as a reference when you design your programs.

The next chapter continues the design theme by explaining how to design your code with reuse in mind.
