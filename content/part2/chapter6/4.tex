By solving the following exercises, you can practice the material discussed in this chapter. Solutions to all exercises are available with the code download on the bookâ€™s website at \url{www.wiley.com/go/proc++6e}. However, if you are stuck on an exercise, first reread parts of this chapter to try to find an answer yourself before looking at the solution from the website.

\begin{itemize}
\item
Exercise 6-1: What does it mean to make the common case easy and the unlikely case possible?

\item
Exercise 6-2: What is the number-one strategy for reusable code design?

Exercise 6-3: Suppose you are writing an application that needs to work with information about people. One part of the application needs to keep a list of customers with data such as a list of recent orders, loyalty card number, and so on. Another part of the application needs to keep track of employees of your company that have an employee ID, job title, and so on. To satisfy these requirements, you decide to design a class called Person that contains their name, phone number, address, list of recent orders, loyalty card number, salary, employee ID, job title (engineer, senior engineer, . . .), and more. What do you think of such a class? Are there any improvements that you can think of?
