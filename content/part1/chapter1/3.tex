After this crash course in C++ and the Standard Library, you are ready to become a professional C++ programmer. When you start getting deeper into the C++ language later in this book, you can refer to this chapter to brush up on parts of the language you may need to review. Going back to some of the sample code in this chapter may be all you need to bring a forgotten concept back to the forefront of your mind.

The next chapter goes deeper in on how strings are handled in C++, because almost every program youâ€™ll write will have to work with strings one way or another.
