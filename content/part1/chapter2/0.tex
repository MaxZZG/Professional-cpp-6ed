Every program that you write will use strings of some kind. With the old C language, there is not much choice but to use a dumb null-terminated character array to represent a string. Unfortunately, doing so can cause a lot of problems, such as buffer overflows, which can result in security vulnerabilities. The C++ Standard Library includes a safe and easy-to-use std::string class that does not have these disadvantages.

Because strings are so important, this chapter, early in the book, discusses them in more detail.
