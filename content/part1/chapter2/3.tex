This chapter discussed the C++ string and string\_view classes and what their benefits are compared to plain old C-style character arrays. It also explained how a number of helper functions make it easier to convert numerical values into strings and vice versa, and it introduced the concept of raw string literals.

The chapter finished with a discussion of the string formatting library, used throughout examples in this book. It is a powerful mechanism to format strings with fine-grained control over how the formatted output should look.

The next chapter discusses guidelines for good coding style, including code documentation, decomposition, naming, code formatting, and other tips.
